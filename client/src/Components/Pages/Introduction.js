              <p className = "text"> Like the kids who sent the letter to Tim and Moby,you have probably seen some very scary news about COVID-19 since the begining of 2020.

So it invades an organisms' body and turns its cells into virus factories. When the viruses invade the body, the make the body weak and sometimes result in sickness or diseases.</p>
              <p className = "text">COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person to person, including between people who are physically near each other (within about 6 feet). Although rare, another way that some people have caught the virus by touching infected surfaces.
